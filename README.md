# PythonBasic

Welcome to PythonBasic! This is a simple project that shows you how to work with different types of files in Python. It's perfect for beginners who want to learn how to handle JSON and CSV files.

## What's Inside?

### 1. JSON Examples (`sample_json.py`)
This file shows you how to work with JSON files (a common way to store data). You'll learn how to:
- Read JSON data from a file
- Write JSON data to a file
- Change JSON data (like updating values)
- Get data from the internet (like a website)
- Filter and find specific information in JSON

### 2. CSV Examples (`sample_csv.py`)
This file teaches you how to work with CSV files (like Excel spreadsheets). You'll learn how to:
- Read data from a CSV file
- Write data to a new CSV file
- Change how the data looks (like using different separators)
- Pick which columns you want to keep
- Work with headers (the titles at the top of each column)

## Files in This Project

### Data Files
- `countries.csv` - A list of countries and their information
- `countries_default_csv.csv` - A new file created by the program with filtered country data
- `sample.json` - An example JSON file
- `sample_write.json` - A new JSON file created by the program
- `sample_without_success_content.json` - Another new JSON file with some data removed

## How to Get Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Download or copy all these files to your computer
3. Open your terminal or command prompt
4. Run these commands to see the examples:
   ```bash
   python sample_json.py
   python sample_csv.py
   ```

## What You Need
- A computer with Python 3 installed
- That's it! All the tools we use come with Python

## Tips for Beginners
- Don't worry if you don't understand everything at first
- Try running the programs and see what happens
- You can change the code and see what happens
- If something doesn't work, check if you have all the files in the same folder

Happy coding! ðŸš€
